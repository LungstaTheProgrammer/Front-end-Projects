# **Front-end Samples**

## **Description**

In This project I will demonstrate how to use 
Machine Learning Algorithms -Recurrent Neural Networks 
[using Tensorflow KERAS] - to do time series analysis, in partucilar:
Bitcoin Price Prediction.

## **Getting Started**

Simply clone the repository and run the files using a live-server 
or copy the file directory on the index.html file and paste it in the
browser search bar and run it.

## **Note**

These are a few of many front-end projects that I've made. I cannot 
post the rest because I deleted them. I will, however, post more as soon
as I make them.
